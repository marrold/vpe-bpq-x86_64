# vpe-bpq-x86_64

Files to build a docker container that runs an instance of [bpq](https://www.cantab.net/users/john.wiseman/Documents/BPQ32.html). Heavily inspired by [VE3LSR's project](https://github.com/VE3LSR/docker-linbpq)

It's intended for use with the [Virtual Packet Environment](https://wiki.oarc.uk/virtual_packet_environment) but might be useful to someone else.

The source for building the container can be found [here](https://github.com/marrold/vpe-bpq)

**NOTE**: This is for x86_64 hosts. ARM support coming soon

# Usage 

It's assumed you'll be using this container with docker-compose. See `docker-compose.yml` for an example.
